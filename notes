To improve the model:

experiment with different network architectures, or just change the dimensions of the LeNet layers
add regularization features like drop out or L2 regularization to make sure the network doesn't overfit the training data
tune the hyperparameters
improve the data pre-processing with steps like normalization and setting a zero mean
augment the training data by rotating or shifting images or by changing colors
